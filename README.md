- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jordan Lesniak
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science, Astrophysics, data management, astronomy, nuclear science
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m have recently completed bachelors degrees in both Data Science and Astrophysics
- ðŸ“« How to reach me, my email is lesniak6@msu.edu. the link to my LinkedIn account is www.Linkedin.com/in/jordan-lesniak.

- This repository is set up to show off some of my personal coding projects over the course of my career at Michigan State University, some are personal projects,
others are class projects. I also have an extensive amount of original code that I have been a crucial part of writing while performing my research at the 
Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) on campus, but for obvious reasons, at the moment that code cannot be shared to the public.


A little about myself:

I am a recently graduated Michigan State University alumni, with bachelors of science degrees in Data Science and Astrophysics. I am a part of a research group at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University. My group has published a paper about the original research I have been conducting over the two years. We do our research using Python code, that was all hand-written by my team and me. I have an extensive knowledge of coding languages, primarily in Python, but I am also proficient in C++, R, and Mathematica. I have many personal projects that I have done over my years at Michigan State University in all of the languages stated previously. I also currently am working a supervisor position for the Intramural Sports Program at Michigan State University, which is the largest student employer on Michigan State's campus. This position gives me great experience in leading a crew of people and getting first hand leadership skills, as well as many other intangibles.
