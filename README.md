- This repository is set up to show off some of my personal coding projects over the course of my career at Michigan State University, some are class projects,
others are personal projects. I also have an extensive amount of original code that I have been a crucial part of writing while performing my research at the 
Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) on campus, but for obvious reasons, at the moment that code cannot be shared to the public.


A little about myself:

I am a 5th year senior, majoring In Data Science and Astrophysics. I am apart of a research group at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University. 
My group is nearing the conclusion of publishing a new paper about the original research I have been conducting over the past year and a half. We do our research using 
Python code, that was all hand written by my team and I. I have an extensive knowledge of coding languages, primarily in Python, but I am also proficient in C++, R,
and Mathematica. I have many personal projects that I have done over my years here at Michigan State University in all of the languages stated previously. 
I also currently am working a supervisor position for the Intramural Sports Program at Michigan State, which is the largest student employer on Michigan State's campus. 
This position gives me great experience in leading a crew of people and getting first hand leadership skills, as well as many other intangibles
