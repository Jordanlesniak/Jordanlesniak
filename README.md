- This repository is set up to show off some of my personal coding projects over the course of my career at Michigan State University, some are class projects,
others are personal projects. I also have an extensive amount of original code that I have been a crucial part of writing while performing my research at the 
Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) on campus, but for obvious reasons, at the moment that code cannot be shared to the public.


A little about myself:

I am a 5th year senior, completeing bachelors degrees in Data Science and Astrophysics at Michigan State University and graduating MAy, 2022. I am currently apart of a research group at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University. My group and I have recently completed writing an academic research paper and are awaiting full publication into the Physical Review Journal. We conduct our research using Python code, that was all hand written by my team and I. I have an extensive knowledge of coding languages, primarily in Python, but I am also proficient in C++, R,and Mathematica. I have many personal projects that I have completed over my years here at Michigan State. I have spent the past five years of my undergraduate career gaining invaluable experience in many aspects of data science and astrophysics, including data modeling and visualization, machine learning, time series analysis, big data analysis, data structures and algorithms. I also have experience using other software programs like Sklearn, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Tableau, Bokeh, Geopandas, and more. My strengths include being a hardworking, dependable, and self-motivated individual who loves to learn new skills. In addition, my background as an Intramural Sports Supervisor at Michigan State's Recreational Sports and Fitness Services has equipped me with strong leadership skills and the ability to conduct a collaborative and productive team.
